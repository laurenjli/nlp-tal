# scope

In our project, we hope to use word embeddings to explore how sense of identity changes over time. We will focus on this in context of the United States as our corpus will be This American Life podcast transcripts dating back to 1995. Starting as a radio show and now one of the most popular podcasts available, This American Life reaches millions of listeners each week. Each episode focuses on a different theme and incorporates personal stories, essays, and even short fiction. With this diverse mix of stories and themes from around the country, we can use word embeddings to explore how conceptions of identity in the U.S. have changed over time.

# sample

For sampling, we plan to acquire the text of all of the archived This American Life podcast [transcripts online](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/archive). An advantage is that this archive is a census of the This American Life episodes since 1995. Furthermore, This American Life is very unique in its inception and format in that it focuses on different themes each week and has different people around the country sharing stories so there is a diverse range of perspectives in the corpus. However, this corpus is certainly not of all identity-related bodies of text in the U.S. since that time. Alternatives would be looking at other types of news columns or podcasts that focus on personal experience.
