TAL Content Analysis


We hope to use word embeddings to explore how sense of identity changes over time. We will focus on this in context of the United States as our corpus will be "This American Life "podcast transcripts dating back to 1995. Starting as a radio show and now one of the most popular podcasts available, "This American Life" reaches millions of listeners each week. Each episode focuses on a different theme and incorporates personal stories, essays, and even short fiction. With this diverse mix of stories and themes from around the country, we can use word embeddings to explore how conceptions of identity in the U.S. have changed over time.


"This American Life" is one of the most popular podcasts in the United States. From the name itself, it is clear that the podcast is meant to share stories and experiences from around the country. Each listener can either relate to a story being told or learn something new about a stranger’s experience. With all of these individual perspectives in one place, this leads one to wonder if there is something more to be learned about our community at a larger scale. What does identity mean across all of these different stories and themes? Has it changed over time? Understanding how sense of identity has changed over time can give more insight into one’s own.
